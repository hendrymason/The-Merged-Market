# Project Title

The merged marketplace is an NFT marketplace developed with the intention of becoming a permissionless, decentralized application for the sale and purchase of digital tokenized products across multiple blockchains. The target platform for this application remains to be Quai Network, due to its multi-chain modular architecture. Eventually, it could have the potential to become a multi-layer-1 application upon further testing and protocol upgrades. However, we believe Quai Network will be a perfect fit for initial deployment for implementing a multi-chain application.

## Description

The merged marketplace operates similar to traditional marketplaces with the implementation of NFT minting, listings, and traditional auctioning except with future plans of NFT ownership fractionalization, interoperability between multiple blockchains/Layer-1 protocols, and a complete permissionless, decentralized governing stucture operating underneaeth a DAO structure.

The business model operates similar to traditional marketplaces as well, taking a percentage of each transaction within the application - from minting and resales of NFTs.
